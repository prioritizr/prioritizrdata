Dear CRAN volunteers,

Thank you for reviewing this submission. This submission updates the package for compatibility with the new version of the prioritizr R package. It also provides an additional case study dataset, and removes dependencies for _rgeos_ and _rgdal_ in anticipation of their retirement.

Cheers,

Richard Schuster
